    "Become a food critic for your pantry. Write scathing reviews of each item as if they're competing for a Michelin star. That expired can of beans? Zero stars, no ambition.",
    "Create a dramatic audiobook narration of your grocery list. Record yourself reading it with intense emotion, complete with suspenseful pauses before revealing 'milk.'",
    "Start a support group for objects you've neglected. Gather the unused exercise equipment, forgotten craft supplies, and abandoned hobbies. Let them share their feelings.",
    "Invent a new dance move and name it something ridiculous like 'The Confused Penguin' or 'The WiFi Buffering.' Teach it to absolutely no one.",
    "Write a stern but fair performance review for your refrigerator. Evaluate its temperature consistency, lighting, and that weird noise it makes at 3 AM."
