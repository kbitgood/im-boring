## 2026-01-30 - P0-3: Create Animated Pixel Starfield Background
- Completed by Ralph
- Added starfield container to index.html with 3 layers (aria-hidden="true")
- Created CSS starfield in style.css with:
  - Fixed position container with z-index: 0 (behind content)
  - 3 parallax layers: small (1px), medium (1.5px), large (2-2.5px) stars
  - Stars use radial-gradient backgrounds for pixel-perfect rendering
  - Drift animation using translate3d for hardware acceleration (60s, 80s, 120s cycles)
  - Twinkle animation with opacity pulsing (3s, 5s, 7s cycles with staggered delays)
  - will-change: transform, opacity for GPU optimization
  - pointer-events: none so stars don't block clicks
  - Low opacity (0.5-0.7) for readability
  - Some stars tinted with theme colors (cyan, pink, purple)
- Set main-container z-index: 1 to stay above starfield
